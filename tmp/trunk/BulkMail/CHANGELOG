0.4.5
- Switched bag display to highlight items ("pushed") being sent, rather than desaturate items not being sent
- Alt-click toggles items to be sent; all other clicks work normally
- GUI added!
  + Displays current items to be sent
  + Alt-click removes items
  + GUI is functional but incomplete; don't come cryin' to me with GUI-related errors just yet

0.4.0
- Code cleaned up, better logic
- First BulkMail-selected item now attached to the message if no item already attached

0.3.0 -- First Beta Release
- Send-Mail interface implemented
- Default destination for AutoSend implemented

0.2.0
- AutoSend list commands work
- Uses Metrognome to throttle sending of items
- Can now be used as a rudimentary AutoSend mod
- Not responsible for items lost or destroyed in-transit

0.1.0
- Added stuff for adding, removing, and destination-changing of single items to an autosend list
- Added ability to send all items in the autosend list
- While I think everything 'works', there is NO interface.  This is not practical for use yet, so no whining.
