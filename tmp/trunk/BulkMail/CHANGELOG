0.3.0 -- First Beta Release
- Send-Mail interface implemented
- Default destination for AutoSend implemented

0.2.0
- AutoSend list commands work
- Uses Metrognome to throttle sending of items
- Can now be used as a rudimentary AutoSend mod
- Not responsible for items lost or destroyed in-transit

0.1.0
- Added stuff for adding, removing, and destination-changing of single items to an autosend list
- Added ability to send all items in the autosend list
- While I think everything 'works', there is NO interface.  This is not practical for use yet, so no whining.
