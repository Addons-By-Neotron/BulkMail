BulkMail TODO List:

- Find a mod-agnostic method to distinguish (highlight) inventory items to be sent (complete for default UI and any container frames with standard GetIDs)
	+ Identify container frames (complete)
	+ Identify the items contained by each frame (complete)

- Determine a way to add/remove items to auto-send lists. Start with a slash command i.e. /bulkmail to <destination> item [more items...]
	+ Allow item links to be parsed for items (complete)
	+ Allow PT groups to be specified

- Mail Send tab:
	+ If no name in the To: field, then highlight all container items in auto-send list (complete)
	+ If a name is in the To: field, then highlight all items in auto-send list destined for that character (complete)
	+ Clicking inventory items shall highlight/unhighlight items to be sent (complete)
		* Items added with the To: field blank will go to a default destination (complete)
	+ Send button sends all highlighted items to appropriate destinations (complete)
	+ "Clear All" button for unhighlighting everything

- Mail view frame:
	+ Add "Re-send" button to work exactly like the "Return" button for bouncing items back to mules (with one-hour delay)

- BulkMail Send GUI
	+ Shows current pending items to be sent (done)
	+ Alt-click removes items from send cache (done)
	+ Has button to clear all items from being sent
	+ Dragging an item onto it will add it to the current set

- Future plans for GUI
	+ Allow items to be queued up to be sent while away from the mailbox
	+ Add items to AutoSend lists
