BulkMail TODO List:

- Find a mod-agnostic method to distinguish (highlight) inventory items to be sent

- Determine a way to add/remove items to auto-send lists. Start with a slash command i.e. /bulkmail to <destination> item [more items...]
	+ Allow PT groups to be specified

- Mail Send tab:
	+ If no name in the To: field, then highlight all items in auto-send list
    + If a name is in the To: field, then highlight all items in auto-send list destined for that character
    + Clicking inventory items shall highlight/unhighlight items to be sent
    	* Items added with the To: field blank will go to a default destination
    + Send button sends all highlighted items to appropriate destinations
    + "Clear All" button for unhighlighting everything

- Mail view frame:
	+ Add "Re-send" button to work exactly like the "Return" button for bouncing items back to mules (with one-hour delay)
